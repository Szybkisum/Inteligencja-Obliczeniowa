First of all, there were problems with check-in, we couldn't find the paid reservation for an hour, the hotel was nice, the rooms were nice, the hairdryer didn't work, and they replaced it for me on the phone. But the most disgusting thing about this story is that I forgot a package with three new elevators in my room (I remember it clearly, I didn't put the bag with them in my suitcase), and these thieves pretended they didn't find anything. I understand some other things, but underwear! It's just horrible! I will never choose this hotel again and I don't advise you to. There are a lot of negative reviews about the staff. it's a shame that I found out about it afterwards.
