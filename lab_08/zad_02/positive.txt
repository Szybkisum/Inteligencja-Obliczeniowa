I had a fantastic stay at this hotel! The rooms were spotless and modern, with everything thoughtfully designed for comfort. The location couldn’t be better—just steps from the central station, with an underground route that makes access super easy, especially with luggage or in bad weather.

A nice touch was the free juice and fresh apples available in the lobby—great for a quick refreshment any time of day. The staff was welcoming and efficient, adding to the overall positive experience. Highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers!
Everything was perfect.
